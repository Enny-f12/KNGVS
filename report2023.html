    <h1>2022 Report</h1> <br>
    <p>Game-Changing Edition
        KNGVS 5.0
        2022
        We laid the ground work to expand to 5 summer vacation schools in
        Ibadan. This game-changing new initiative in the 2022 edition enabled us
        to reach a larger number of young children, and empower more families,
        elementary school teachers, and volunteers in our community. If we 'catch them young' by helping
        them acquire healthy dietary habits
        and skills in childhood, we will have
        a generation prepared to lead a life
        free of unprecedented health
        problems in the future. <br> <br>
        KNGVS partnered with five
        schools in Ibadan, at which we
        organised hands-on educational
        Nutri-garden™ activities, to
        enrich and make their vacation
        schools worthwhile experiences
        for their pupils!
        From 1 August to 6 September ,
        2022, we engaged the kids in the
        Nutri-garden™-2-Fork
        adventure - hands-on gardening,
        nutriton education and healthy
        cooking/ food demonstration, as
        part of their vacation school
        activities.</p> <br>

    <h2>KNGVS Project Report</h2>
        <p>KNGVS volunteers make us thrive. In the 2022
            edition, we launched an expanded training for
            twenty-three young and passionate volunteers
            (the KNG Corps) to help implement Nutri garden™-2-fork adventure in the long vacation
            activities of the five partner schools. Our efforts
            resulted in a vibrant holiday experience for the
            schools and the children. <br> <br>
            KNG Corps dedicated their time and energy
            throughout August and the first week of
            September, to set up and nurture six nutri gardens to grow local veggies. They helped the
            children to link the growing of veggies (...and
            foods in general) to nutrition concepts that
            promote their well-being and health. <br> <br>
            The icing on the cake! healthy cooking/
            food demonstration sessions where the
            KNG Corps assisted the kids to use veggies
            harvested from the nutri-garden to prepare
            simple healthy meals and snacks that they
            loved!!!. This aspect of KNGVS helps drive
            the "From nutri-garden-to-fork!" concept
            home. <br> <br>
            A newsletter which summarised the week's
            learning and recipe, were given to the kids
            to take home for family activities at the end
            of each week.
            <br> <br>
          <em> Twenty nutri-garden & interactive nutri-education lessons, ten
            healthy cooking/ food demonstrations sessions, six open garden
            days, ten guest lectures, one excursion, one garden-2-fork
            exhibition</em>

    <h2>More Progress</h2>
   <p>It was even more fun when researchers from
    different institutions visited, to take the
    children through diverse aspects of learning
    about the garden environment. Dr
    Olajumoke Alabi, an entomologist from the
    Department of Crop Protection and
    Environmental Biology, UI, was at hand to
    talk to the children about GARDEN FRIENDS
    AND FOES, referring to good and bad
    insects. She also taught the kids songs and
    how to make ladybirds and bugs!!!
    When Mrs Nkechi Isienyi and her research
    team visited from the Department of Tree
    and Soil Nutrition, Forestry Research
    Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), it was time to take
    the children through the importance and
    care of soil, as well as how to make
    composts for achieving bountiful harvests.</p> <br>
    <em>"I am excited that my daughter is
        learning about gardening and
        relationship with the
        environment"
        -Parent</em> <br>
        <p>We also had exciting new content additions
            like the open garden day. Parents and the
            general public were invited to participate and
            learn gardening and nutrition from the
            children. Our guests also got their hands dirty
            harvesting some fresh veggies from the kids'
            Nutri-garden™. It was fun all the way!</p>
